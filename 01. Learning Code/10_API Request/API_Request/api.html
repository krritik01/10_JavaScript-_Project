            <p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of features and rules that exist inside a software program (the application) enabling interaction with it through software - as opposed to a human user interface. The API can be seen as a simple contract (the interface) between the application offering it and other items, such as third-party software or hardware.</p>
            <p>Whenever we receive data from a URL, it will come in a string. To convert this string into JSON, we use the method JSON.parse()</p>
